Allows for the gatekeeping of role mentions on your discord server.

Configure the config.json with a vetted role name. Only users with this role will be able to mention other roles.
Then add a list of mentionable roles.

Use /call in Discord to display a list of callable roles.
The bot will check that you have the vetted role, and if so, will send the call to arms.
If you do not have the role, you will receive an ephemeral feedback message and will not be able to rally the gang.
